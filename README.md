# metis-canvas - DEPRECATED

metis-canvas last version, 1.0.1, was released in 2016. The project is no longer maintained and 
should not be used anymore.

All **users should migrate** to its direct successor [onoffcanvas](https://github.com/onokumus/onoffcanvas), or another alternative.

In a few months, the GitHub project will be marked as archived, so everything will be read-only.
